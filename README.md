# Deep Learning For 3D Mesh Saliency Prediction
This project presents a saliency prediction model for point clouds based on deep learning. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first deep learning approach that predicts saliency on point clouds using real saliency data as ground truth, instead of using point-based methods or methods which study the rarity or curvature of a mesh splitting it in clusters of points. An experiment with 32 people was carried out in order to collect the gaze data that served as ground truth. Then a deep neural network based on previous work, [PointNet++](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3295222.3295263), was used and adapted to our problem in order to predict 3D saliency on objects. Finally results were obtained by training this network with the data collected in the experiment. The study proves that the model is able to recognise the most interesting parts of a mesh. This project was my final Master's degree thesis.
